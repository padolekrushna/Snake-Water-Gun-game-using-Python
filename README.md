2) Number Guessing Game in Python
   If the User inputs range, let’s say from 1 to 100. And compiler randomly selected any number
    And now the guessing game started if user entered 50 as his/her first guess. The compiler shows “Try Again! You guessed too high”
    The user enters 25 as his/her second guess. This time compiler will show, “Try Again! You guessed too small
    and if number is correct then it say you guess correct and return how many times it guess taken.
